  <h1> First Task of Level 1</h1>
    
  <h2> About Project</h2>
In this project, I analyzed a restaurant dataset to identify food trends. <br>
The goal of the first task was to:

1. Identify the top three most common cuisines in the dataset and
2. Calculate the percentage of restaurants serving each of these cuisines.


<h1>Tools & Technologies:</h1>

To achieve this, I used the following tools and technologies:<br>

1. Pandas: For data analysis, cleaning, exploration, and manipulation.
2. NumPy: For efficient numerical computations.
3. Matplotlib: For data visualization, including plots, charts, and graphs.
4. Seaborn: For statistical data visualization, building on Matplotlib.
5. Counter (Collections): For counting hashable objects, such as frequency analysis.
6. Jupyter Notebook(IDEs): As the primary environment for data processing and analysis.<br><br>
These tools enabled me to effectively extract insights and meaning from the data.

<h1>Results:</h1>
<p>I identified the top three most common cuisines and calculated the percentage of restaurants serving each:<br>
1. North Indian: 3,960 restaurants (41.50%)<br>
2. Chinese: 2,735 restaurants (28.66%)<br>
3. Fast Food: 1,986 restaurants (20.81%)<br>
